# Discord Command Manager

Manage discord commands on the web

It's a React app, do what ya gotta do. 

Also requires a discord API proxy if you're not doing it in Electorn or something where you can change the User-Agent. It uses mine at https://discord-commands.artex.workers.dev/api/v9 but it's completely understandable to not trust it. The code for it is in [workers/index.js](/workers/index.js) if you want to use it. I host it using [CloudFlare workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

And yeah I know the code isnt the prettiest, and I should probably add more validation and use modals, but I didn't care. Just wanted something that worked, but you're free to fork it or submit a PR to add/change stuff.
